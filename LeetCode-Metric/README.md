## Live Project
Check out the live version of Leet-Metric [here](https://agrawalaman02.github.io/Leet-Metric/).

## Project Overview
Leet-Metric is a web-based project that allows users to search for LeetCode profiles and visually track their progress with an interactive pie chart. It fetches user data via an API and presents detailed statistics about their progress on LeetCode problems.

## Features
- **Pie Chart Integration**: Displays LeetCode progress using an interactive pie chart.
- **Smooth Animations**: Added animations to the username search and transitions for elements like buttons and pie charts.
- **Shaky Animation**: Special shaky effect on buttons and pie chart for a more dynamic user experience.
- **Stat Cards**: Includes cards to display important metrics like ranking, total problems solved, contribution points, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and looks great across different screen sizes.
- **Enhanced Typography**: Used attractive fonts to ensure a visually appealing interface.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (with animations and transitions)
- JavaScript (API fetching and DOM manipulation)

## API Used
Data is fetched from [LeetCode Stats API](https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com/) to display user progress and statistics.

## Inspiration
Special thanks to **Love Babbar** whose YouTube video helped me learn how to create the pie chart and fetch the API.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add a leaderboard section to compare multiple users.
- [ ] Implement a feature to visualize users' submissions over time.
- [ ] Introduce user authentication for personalized dashboards.
